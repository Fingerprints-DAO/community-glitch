    question: 'What are the degradation dynamics?',
    answer: (
      <>
        &rsquo;glitch&lsquo; is dynamic conceptual blockchain art and an
        experiment in how to introduce degradation in a digital artwork. In this
        respect it is also a commentary on secondary market dynamics. It is
        intended to be fun and playful. The degradation is part of the artwork
        and a degraded artwork is still an artwork.

        1. The initial collector receives an original photo with subliminal
        animation as GIF-file.
        <br />
        2. After the first sale or transfer, the animation disappears, leaving
        only the photo.
        <br />
        3. After the second sale or transfer the photo fades 50%.
        <br />
        4. After the third sale or transfer the photo will disappear leaving
        only a placeholder.

        You can refresh your art to the mint original clicking the refresh
        button on the specific token page of your piece. The refresh will
        perform a blockchain transaction involving paying a small fee.

    question:
      'How can I refresh my art to the mint original if has been degraded?',
    answer: (
      <>
        You can refresh your art to the mint original clicking the refresh
        button on the specific token page of your piece. The refresh will
        perform a blockchain transaction involving paying a small fee of 0.004
        <EtherSymbol />
        <LineSpace />
        The fee is intended as a substitute for creator royalties. When trading
        on a marketplace the glitch tokens are 0% creator fee, so royalties
        free. By refreshing your art you are supporting the project and the
        artist.

    question: 'Are you using smart contracts to run the dynamic mechanics?',
    answer: (
      <>
        The 50 1/1s edition dynamic mechanics run on smart contracts on the
        Ethereum blockchain and each transfer degrades the art automatically.
        Also the artwork refresh and burn runs on a smart contract and is all
        onchain.

        Initially a server is used to quickly provide the art, and then we will
        move the art to IPFS as soon as things settle down after the claim.
        <LineSpace />
        misha de ridder is running a dedicated IPFS node for all his art and the
        art he collected in his studio. You can run your own IPFS node too and
        help to take care of the &rsquo;glitch&lsquo; art and the art of others.

    question:

    answer: (

        You cannot select a specific piece to bid on.
        <LineSpace />
        This is a ranked auction, meaning all collectors are bidding on all
        pieces. When the auction ends, each collector will be assigned a token
        id according to their position on bid ranking (The highest bidder gets
        #1 and the lowest one in the 50 bids get #50)
        <LineSpace />
        You can bid as many times as youâ€™d like. Each bid will be positioned in
        the ranking.

        the image aspect ratio. Print redemption costs $3,000, which can be paid

        Certain communities and holders of NFT could be eligible for a discount

        Discounts work only by minting on the website - not directly on
        Etherscan.
        <LineSpace />
        For the 1/1 auction pieces, discounts will be applied when the user
        claims the nfts and refunds. They must bid and commit ETH to bid, then
        we calculate the refund based on lowest bid + discount.
