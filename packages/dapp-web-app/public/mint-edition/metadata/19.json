The act of erasing can involve both destruction and generation, transformation and reimagination — allowing for new possibilities to emerge. \nPlaying with notions of loss and re-coding, misha has re-animated the graffiti, inserting liminal afterimages of what was once there: faces, text, and indecipherable symbols. The result is a series of images that blur the lines between abstract painting, photography, animation, and token art. glitch meditates on the idea of “unwanted information,” — the delineation between messages that are wanted, seen, and proliferated, and those that are not. Like memes for the public space, graffiti is a subversive, spontaneous form of communication meant for the masses.\n The edition piece is a randomized composite image of all 50 animations, each representing one of the many possible options of the full collection mosaic, minted as HTML-page. The mint is limited to 510 editions. The art is slowly degraded as more editions are minted following the steps of the 1/1s — until the last 20 editions are left completely degraded. There's no way to restore, what you mint is what you get.","attributes":[{"trait_type":"decay","value":"0.67%","display_type":"boost_number"}]}
